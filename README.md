# Bort

Is a pretty unambitious, lightweight vulkan wrapper on top of [ash](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash) aiming to reduce some boilerplate, call destructors with `Drop`, reference count resource dependencies, store create-info properties etc. Makes some assumptions of use-case to simplify things (e.g. merging image and image view into one struct) but it should all be pretty easy to modify.

Oh, also this is like all unsafe from the vulkan spec perspective i.e. there's very little spec validity checking. I don't really care because that's what the validation layers are for so I cbf marking everything as `unsafe` for now.
