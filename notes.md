# TODO

- Buffer::new_from_memory_flags -> only need required/preferred_flags a lot of the time??
- make all getters inline for consistency (don't know where the chains will be)
- properties from create_info_builder
- write descriptor sets
- spec constants
- instance and device properties
- cargo feature to use rc instead of arc
